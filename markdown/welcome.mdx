# The Evolution of Frontend Development: From Static Pages to Dynamic Web Apps

Frontend development has come a long way since the early days of the internet. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore the evolution of frontend development, how it has transformed, and what the future holds for developers.

## The Early Days: Static Pages

In the early days of the web, websites were simple, static pages with minimal interactivity. HTML was the main tool used by developers to create content, and CSS was introduced to enhance the design. These early websites were simple, but as the demand for dynamic content grew, the limitations of static pages became clear.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My First Website</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
        color: #333;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple static page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
